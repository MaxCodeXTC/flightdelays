# Predicting flight delays using Department of Transportation data

This project was one of the admissions challenges for my Fellowship.AI cohort. The task was to build predictive models forecasting flight delays, based on historical flight data provided by the Department of Transportation. I completed the challenge using R and mySQL, building two types models for an imaginary risk stratification scenerio involving flights between Airbnb's major offices.

* [**Flight_Delay_Code_Only.r**](Flight_Delay_Code_Only.r) - R script with same code as in the Jupyter Notebook. Draws from the two CSVs below <br>
* [**images**](images) - Contains images used in the Jupyter notebook <br>
* [**data**](data) - Contains the data files used to train the two models
